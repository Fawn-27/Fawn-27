## Hi, I'm Fawn! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me âœ¨
I'm an average human living on Earth. You'll typically find me studying with a busy desktop of >20 tabs and at least two books around me. I like to:
- read (especially dystopian and realistic fiction'
- sing and listen to music,
- code.

I just like learning about coding languages. There's no other reasoning to it.

## What I'm Doing ðŸ’»
- Learning Java
- Crying over CSS
- Creating a homepage
- Trying to figure out Github

Sorry, I don't have a lot of stuff here. Most of my work is on Replit and another editor, and I'm too lazy to transfer some of them. I'll do it eventually. 

## Skills :octocat:
I'm fluent in some of these languages but am still learning others:
