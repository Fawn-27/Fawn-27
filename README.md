## About Me âœ¨
Hi, I'm Fawn! You'll typically find me studying one subject or another or burying my nose into the latest book I could find. I like to:
- read
- sing and listen to music
- code

## What I'm Doing ðŸ’»
- Learning Java
- Creating a homepage
- Trying to figure out Github

Most of my work is found on a different editor, and I'm gradually transferring the files over.
## Skills :octocat:
I'm fluent in some of these languages but am still learning others:
