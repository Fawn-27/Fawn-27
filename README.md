## About Me âœ¨
I'm an average human living on Earth. You'll typically find me studying with a busy of desktop of >30 tabs and at least two books around me. My hobby's 
- reading books - especially dyetopian fiction,
- math, with a preference towards number theory and algebra,
- coding and, naturally, solving dozens of bugs (whether I want to or not).
I just like learning about coding languages. There's no other reasoning to it.

## What I'm Doing
- Learning SQLite3
- Crying over CSS
- Coding shortcuts for things I don't want to do 

## Skills
I'm fluent in some of these languages but am still learning others:
